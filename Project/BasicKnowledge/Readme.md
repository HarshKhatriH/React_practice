1) Difference between Arrow function and normal function call

Ans) 
 -> onClick={() => addTheme()} ---->	When the button is clicked , use Arrow function
 -> onClick={addTheme()}	    
   ----> When the component renders  
   ---> addTheme() is called immediately when the component renders, not when the button is clicked.
